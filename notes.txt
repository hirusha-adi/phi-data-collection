this is my old

class QuestionForm(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    cockroaches = db.Column(db.Boolean)

    created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    last_updated = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow, onupdate=datetime.utcnow)

    # Inspection Record - Location relationship
    location_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('location.id'))
    location = db.relationship('Location', backref=db.backref('forms', lazy=True))
    
    # Inspection Record - User relationship (see who created it)
    user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id')) 
    user = db.relationship('User', backref=db.backref('forms', lazy=True))
